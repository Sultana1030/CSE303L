          Chatbots have evolved how companies can serve their customers. And with the advancements of AI, we will see how AI chatbots are being implemented and evolving for the future. <br><br>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the new wave of technological innovations that is shaping the future. The familiarity of AI started from entertainment mediums such as movies and games from a few decades ago. After that first applications were made in pattern or picture recognition where Brain Station employees gathered first experience about it. Now the usage of AI is more prevalent than ever. Businesses have integrated AI into many facets- from shaping future business decisions to adding to customer experience. Now AI is a staple in any industry, and can be found implemented in a number of different places for us: whether for commercial or personal. <br><br>
          Speech recognition was one of the initial cornerstones for AI. AI chatbots are now being implemented on numerous fronts. There are two different types of chatbots, the one being rule based – answering predetermined questions. The other is the intelligent chatbot, powered by Artificial Intelligence. AI chatbots are used to humanize automated customer services. Through Machine Learning AI chatbots pick up the nuances and responses of human behavior over time. They learn it and bring a human touch to the automated customer services. <br><br>
          One of the biggest benefits chatbots bring to the table is the automated customer service. Customers can come with their query at any time as the services will be available 24/7. And unlike humans, chatbots are able to provide consistent answers to any given query numerous times. The answers are always instant, and the interactions are always recorded for the company to tailor their AI chatbot to best suit customers. And with an AI chatbot, the call-to-action interfaces will be readily available, making transactions instant. Also being programmable, AI chatbots can be programmed to arrange meetings with buyers. And through the power of Machine Learning, the chatbots will constantly improve themselves to better suite needs of the customers. <br><br>
          Not to mention how much expenses are being saved by businesses who incorporate AI chatbots. According to Juniper Research, the banking industry will be saving $7.3 billion by 2023 by implementing AI powered automated customer services.  AI chatbots increase sales and interaction for enterprises. And a chatbot is also a new way to reach out to new customers. Facebook has over 300k chatbots integrated. These AI chatbots interact especially with young consumers, who are the regular majority using social media platforms. AI chatbots come with integrated analytics. With the help of these analytics, businesses get a better understanding of their consumers and their behavior. Companies can tune the interaction of customers with their chatbots and target potential customers.  AI chatbots will show the highest recorded pain points of the consumers, so companies know where to focus and improve their products and services. <br><br>
          We at Brain Station have experience in developing both intelligence based (AI enabled) and rule based chatbots. The chatbot is built up according to the business need, where in most cases it is based on the common queries from the FAQ. We develop the bots according to our client’s specification, where areas of development include how the conversation flows, what information to show,  and how much autonomy the bot will have. For a global leading bio-pharmaceutical enterprise, we develop currently a rule based chatbot for navigating through their web pages. That makes it easier for the doctors to communicate with the company and to retrieve valuable information about the company’s medical products. 
          Our typical development journey starts with fully defined requirements given by our clients. The data input for the bot programming is done by putting question sets. The bot intent is to be set next by analyzing the input and the intents are classified by the question sets based on different subjects. Then all the information is funneled out based on the different subjects. This way the conversation is mapped for the bot. As the development progresses, the requirements of the project may not meet the initial expectations- which is done by troubleshooting the bot and letting it get familiar with the different inputs. The development is done through constant feedback and data sharing between us and our clients. And over time the developed bot will be able to function properly, and through Machine Learning, will be able to give out expected answers (outputs) for the questions. <br><br>
          On that basis we also developed an AI enabled chatbot for Germany. This chatbot can guide you to the nearest gas station anywhere in Germany. So the inputs for this chatbot will be your current location and what sort of fuel you are looking for. And thus the output is the nearest gas station based on your inputs. Like any other AI based chatbot system, this chatbot solution learned the locations and conversation patterns through Machine Learning. <br><br>
