        <h2>PASSION</h2>
        <p id="ptag">
          We just love software development - it's as simple as that. That love brings in the passion to create something amazing. And the passion gives us the energy that drives us.
        </p>
        <h2>CULTURE</h2>
        <p id="ptag">
        We are not just a place where software gets made. We see our space as a place for solving problems, for fun and creativity, for crafting things that are as simple to use as they are beautiful to look at. Our culture is open and without hierarchy.
      </p> 
        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <p id="ptag">
        Our technical team represents more than 10 years of software development experience. We are a very mixed group with expertise ranging from device driver developments to style sheets.  On the technology preference front we are equally varied, revolving our lives from Java to .NET to objective C to C++ with occasional dips into something more unusual like erlang or sleeping!
      </p>
        <h2>PROCESS</h2>
        <img src="images/process2.png" width="500px" height="200px" style="float: right;">
        <p id="ptag">
        We are great believers of the Agile methodology in software development. Everything is bound to change and we are prepared for that change. We love to develop in small steps - giving our customers something to look at and give us feedback in at every stage.
